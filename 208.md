Summary: https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/wiki/Bridged-IRC-networks

Right now we're not letting people bridge to arbitrary networks of their choice, but curating the bridges we set up (in order to ensure that we connect at scale to those networks in a way that doesn't upset them, and get permission first, setup I:lines etc, add the networks to Riot's official config.json etc).

So let's have an official backlog here for the networks that folks want to be connected to.  Ones i've already heard about are:

_Room alias format is listed here for non-Riot clients which don't support the new room directory API._

 ⚡️ _indicates the network has IPv6 support (or at least advertising on IPv6 addresses). This makes it much easier for us to connect to because we don't need to maintain separate ident servers, **so they will get chosen first**._

- ~~Freenode~~ (`#freenode_#channame:matrix.org` - No leading `_` )
- ~~Moznet~~ (`#mozilla_#channame:matrix.org` - No leading `_`)
- ~~OFTC~~ (`#_oftc_#channame:matrix.org`)
- ~~Snoonet~~  (alt Reddit) (`#_snoonet_#channame:matrix.org`)
- ~~hackint~~ (`#channame:irc.hackint.org`)
- ~~Foonetic~~ irc.foonetic.net  (XKCDland) ⚡️ 
- geekshed : irc.geekshed.net (Jupiter Broadcasting) 
- ~~Rizon~~ irc.rizon.net (`#_rizon_#channame:matrix.org`) ⚡️

- SpigotMC : irc.spi.gt ⚡️ 
- Furnet : ipv6.furnet.org ⚡️ 
- MIXXnet : irc.ipv6.mixxnet.net ⚡️
- IRCHighway : irc.irchighway.net
- euIRC : irc.euirc.net ⚡️

No planned support / previously supported but not anymore:
- Twitch : irc.chat.twitch.tv (no planned support, server protocol too diverged)
- W3C (`#_w3c_#channame:matrix.org`) - Disabled. No listening IPv6 IRCd anymore.

Folks: if you have particular networks you want bridged, please add them here.

2017-01-11 status update by @Kegsay : Over the past few months we've encountered various fun and exciting failure modes with our existing set of IRC bridges. For example, we got invite spammed from IRC which resulted in https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/pull/309 , we need to resolve the issue of idle users on the matrix side (https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/pull/340 , https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/issues/304 ), we needed to scale our startup times ( https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/pull/308 ), allow people to persist NickServ passwords ( https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/pull/251 ), prevent NickServ/ChanServ/etc from being rate-limited on the matrix-side ( https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-irc/pull/246 ), etc. As a result, we're still ironing out the UX on the IRC bridge. Once this has stabilised, we'll be consulting this list to work out how to proceed expanding the set of IRC networks we offer. Thank you for your patience.

2017-03-02 status update by @Kegsay : We are now bridging GIMPNet and have removed W3C support due to them dropping their IPv6-enabled IRCd.
